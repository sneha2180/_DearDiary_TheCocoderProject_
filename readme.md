<p align="center">Dear diary,The sky is falling<br>
It's fucking boring<br>
I'm going braindead, isolated<br>
God is a shithead<br>
And we're his rejects<br>
Traumatized for breakfast<br>
I can't stomach any more survival horror</p>
<br>
<p align="center">We are gifting you a personal diary 'Dear Diary ' . You can write down your emotions whenever you feel to .......</p>

 ***We are very thankful for giving us this opportunity so we could really use our brains on the project. This project helped us to understand some core concepts and workflows on creating a personal diary using Python. We learned how to take notes from users and save it in different databases. We got to know about several modules in Python which were used for certain needs in the project. Overall it was a great learning experience.***
